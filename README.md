# Official-Release: Social Network Project

### Overview

This repository contains the official release of a Social Network application developed as a project for the course "Progettazione Applicazioni Web e Mobile" at the University of Camerino.

The project was conceptualized and developed entirely by me (Ionut Bogdan Donici) as a practical exploration into modern web and mobile application design.
